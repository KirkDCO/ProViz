The source code is available on GitHub in SomaLogic’s ProViz repository. To use ProViz, it is recommended to install R and RStudio, clone the ProViz repository or download the code, and run it using the RStudio IDE. See RStudio’s Shiny page for details of using RStudio to run a Shiny application. RStudio’s Shiny Server can also be used to run ProViz from a server, providing access through a managed web portal. Some additional packages are required for ProViz. Following is a list of the required packages and the versions used during ProViz development and testing. All of the following packages are available through The Comprehensive R Network - CRAN. DT (0.17) dplyr (1.0.6) ggbeeswarm (0.6.0) ggplot2 (3.3.3) magrittr (2.0.1) plotly (4.9.3) readr (1.4.0) shiny (1.6.0) shinydashboard (0.7.1) shinyWidgets (0.6.0) tidyr (1.1.3) Additionally, ProViz uses the SomaDataIO v5.1.0 package available from SomaLogic’s SomaDataIO GitHub repository. Note that SomaDataIO requires the BioBase package from Bioconductor, which requires a slightly different installation procedure: if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) { install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) } BiocManager::install(&quot;Biobase&quot;) Installing dependencies can be accomplished using the remotes package and the following series of R commands. # install the remotes package install.packages(&#39;remotes&#39;) # install the individual dependencies remotes::install_version(&#39;DT&#39;, version = &#39;0.17&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;dplyr&#39;, version = &#39;1.0.6&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;ggbeeswarm&#39;, version = &#39;0.6.0&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;ggplot2&#39;, version = &#39;3.3.3&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;magrittr&#39;, version = &#39;2.0.1&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;plotly&#39;, version = &#39;4.9.3&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;readr&#39;, version = &#39;1.4.0&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;shiny&#39;, version = &#39;1.6.0&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;shinydashboard&#39;, version = &#39;0.7.1&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;shinyWidgets&#39;, version = &#39;0.6.0&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_version(&#39;tidyr&#39;, version = &#39;1.1.3&#39;, repos = &#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) remotes::install_github(&#39;Somalogic/SomaDataIO@v5.1.0&#39;) Once all dependecies have been installed successfully, open RStudio and navigate to the folder containing the ProViz R code. Open any of the R code files - global.R, ui.R, or server.R. The code window in RStudio will have a button at the top-left that says ‘Run App’. Press this button to start ProViz. See RStudio’s Shiny page for details of using RStudio to run a Shiny application. The Run App button on the server.R code window in RStudio. Installation of R and RStudio on different operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), may require administrator privileges as well as additional steps in order to complete the installation process. Contact your IT professional for assistance if you are not familiar with performing these types of operations. 1.1.2 DockerHub ProViz can also be run using Docker or Docker Desktop using the image available through SomaLogic’s Dockerhub account. For more information on installing and running Docker Desktop, refer to the Docker Desktop home page. Once Docker Desktop is installed, the ProViz image can be pulled from dockerhub by executing docker pull somalogic/proviz from a terminal window on Mac or Linux, or from a command prompt on Windows. Once the image has been successfully pulled, the image name will be displayed in the Docker Desktop’s Dashboard application. Docker Dashboard showing the ProViz image available. In Docker Desktop, the image can be started by clicking run. A dialog box will be presented in which a local port number needs to be set (Local Port) in order for a web browser to communicate with the running container. Any available port can be used, and the default 3838 is most likely a good option. (You may initially see a smaller dialog box with the port setting hidden. Clicking on the triangle at the right will expand the dialog to show all options.) Setting the Local Port to 3838. Once the Local Port is set, click Run. in the Dashboard, you will now see that the image is running. Clicking on Open in Browser will connect your web browser to the container through the Local Port set in the last step. Docker Dashboard showing that the container is running. When your browser opens, you should see the ProViz main panel. The main ProViz panel. Installing Docker or Docker Desktop and setting configurations to enable the application to work may require administrator privileges as well as additional steps.

The example_data.adat file consists of 192 samples (including clinical samples and controls) and is representative of a typical ADAT file SomaLogic customer’s receive. 1.3 ProViz Navigation The main ProViz panel. In ProViz, you can navigate to different panels using the navigation pane on the left by clicking on the name of the panel. Each chapter in this tutorial gives a brief tutorial on how to use the options in the corresponding panel. Users can select how the SOMAmer-associated data will be listed in selection boxes across all ProViz panels by selecting an option under Label SOMAmers by: Sequence ID, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol. The latter two options are most likely more familiar to most users than Sequence IDs. Label types can be changed at any point when using ProViz. When labels are changed, there will be a short delay while the user interface is updated with the new labels, and progress bar indicates the status of the updates. "],["load-and-filter-adat.html", "Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel 2.2 Load an ADAT file 2.3 Filter ADAT contents", " Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel The ProViz Load and Filter ADAT panel after opening the example_data.adat file. 2.2 Load an ADAT file To open an ADAT file, click on the Browse… button and locate an ADAT file. Once selected, the ADAT file will be opened and processed, and a preview of the content will be shown in the table at the right. ADAT files may have over 7,000 columns of SomaScan Assay data for every row in the file, so large files may take a few moments to load. After the ADAT file is loaded, details of the file content are displayed. Here we see that there are 192 total rows (corresponding to individual samples), and 5,318 data columns. Of those data columns, 5,284 are SOMAmer data columns and 34 are Meta Data columns. These Meta Data columns contain assay-related data such as the Plate ID, Scanner ID, normalization data, and any sample-specific data that was submitted to SomaLogic with the samples. For the example_data.adat file, Sex and Age are included as well as additional sample-related content. The ADAT Preview table can be scrolled horizontally and vertically, as well as searched for specific content (Search: box in upper-right). The number of rows displayed per page can be adjusted with the Show … entries box in the upper-left, and you can step through various pages by clicking on Previous, Next, or a specific page number at the bottom-right. SomaScan Assay data are not displayed in the preview table. 2.3 Filter ADAT contents Samples present in the ADAT file can be filtered based on Meta Data or SomaScan Assay data. When the ADAT file is processed, data columns are divided into Categorical (non-numeric) or Continuous (numeric) categories. All filtering operations are cumulative. 2.3.1 Categorical Filters The categorical filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on categorical data using the Categorical Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By selection box, which populates the Remove selection box with the unique categorical values in the ADAT file. Data values can be selected by clicking on one or more values in the Remove selection box. Once all selections are made, clicking the Apply button will remove those samples from the data, and the Data Dimensions box will be updated with new information. In this example, the SampleType column is selected and the unique entries for this column are shown: Buffer, Calibrator, QC, and Sample. By clicking on Buffer, Calibrator, and QC, to select them, the assay control samples can be removed from the data file. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.2 Continuous Filters The continuous filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on continuous data using the Continuous Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By which will update the Range slider with the minimum and maximum values for that data column. By moving the minimum and maximum sliders, a desired range of the selected variable can be chosen and all samples with values outside that range will be removed. In this example, the Age column is selected and the sliders adjusted to keep only those samples with Age from 35 to 70. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.3 Reset Filters The original ADAT contents are always preserved and can be retrieved by clicking the Reset All Filters button. 2.3.4 Download ADAT Once filtering has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten. Keeping good notes regarding the filtering operations is essential to recall how the ADAT was modified when it is returned to at a later date. To assist in this record keeping, an additional entry is made in the ^HEADER section of the ADAT file listing the operations that were performed. "],["merge-data.html", "Chapter 3 Merge Data 3.1 Selecting a Data File to Merge 3.2 Selecting Columns in the ADAT and the Data File 3.3 Specifying the Type of Merge 3.4 Merge 3.5 Download Adat", " Chapter 3 Merge Data Data pertaining to individual samples and stored in external files can be merged with the proteomic data in an ADAT file using the Merge Data panel. The Merge Data panel 3.1 Selecting a Data File to Merge External data must be stored in a comma-delimited or a tab-delimited file, and the first row should contain column names. The file containing the data can be uploaded to ProViz by selecting the Browse button and navigating to the file. Once uploaded, a preview of the data file will be displayed below the ADAT Preview. 3.2 Selecting Columns in the ADAT and the Data File In order to merge external data with the data in the ADAT file, each file should have one column that provides a way to match rows between the two files. Ideally, the columns should have all unique values and should match in a one-to-one fashion between the ADAT file and the external data file. The columns do not need to have the same name. If there are duplicate IDs for the selected matching column in either the ADAT file or the external file, rows may be duplicated in order to match all-to-all, leading to a potentially confusing data file. The target column in the ADAT can be selected with the ADAT Merge Column selection box, and the column in the external file can be selected with the Data Merge Column selection box. In this example, each file has a column titled SampleId. All entries in this column in the external file are unique and correspond to the clinical samples’ SampleId values in the ADAT. 3.3 Specifying the Type of Merge The ADAT file typically contains control samples for which external data is not likely available, or the external data file may not have data for all clinical samples. Choosing Keep All ADAT Rows under Type of Merge will retain all rows in the ADAT file and include NA for those rows not found in the external file. Alternatively, only those rows found in both files can be retained by selecting Keep Only Intersection. 3.4 Merge Once all selections are made, initiate the merge by pressing the Merge button. If an error occurs, a message will be displayed in the message box at the bottom of the panel, otherwise, the message box will contain updated data dimension information. The message box will provide the exact error message from the underlying R code, and may not be easily interpreted. Typically, if an error occurs, it is due to selecting columns in either the ADAT or the external file that are not compatible. Careful construction of the external data file and selection of matching columns is critical. 3.5 Download Adat Once merging has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten.

A preview of the original data column and the newly created data column are shown at the right. When ready to create the new group, press the Create New Group Column button, and the new column will be added to the ADAT. In this example, a column titled New Group will be created from the existing SampleType column. Rows with values of Calibrator, Buffer, or QC will be given the label Controls and values of Sample will be given the label Samples. This will provide a useful label to distinguish between all controls and all clinical samples in the ADAT file. 4.3 Download ADAT Once new groups have been created, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button.

The tests available are: correlation - compares two continuous variables using either Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank-based methods t-test - compares the means of two groups; a paired t-test is also available is also available by checking Matched Samples and providing a properly constructed Matching Variable U-test - compares the medians of two groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test; a paired U-test is also available KS-test - compares the distributions of data between two groups ANOVA - Analysis of Variance test of the means of multiple groups; repeated measures ANOVA is also available by checking Matched Samples and providing a properly constructed Matching Variable Kruskal-Wallis - compares the medians of multiple groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA Friedman’s Test - a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA; this test is available instead of Kruskal-Walllis when Matched Samples is checked 6.2 Selecting a Response The Settings box in the Statistical Tests panel. The type of test can be selected from Test Type. The variable containing the response or the grouping labels can be selected from the select box titled Continuous Response (for Correlation tests), Two-group Response (for t-tests, U-tests, or KS-tests), or Multi-group Response (for ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis or Friedman’s Test). The label of the select box will change as different test types are selected. Also, the contents of the select box will be updated with variables consistent with the selected test. After selecting a new response variable, tests will be performed for all SOMAmers in the ADAT, which could take a minute or two. 6.3 Paired, matched or repeated measures tests If a paired t-test, paired U-test, repeated measures ANOVA, or Friedman’s test are required, check the Matched Samples box and select the variable which defines how samples are matched across groups. All matched tests require a complete dataset in which each treatment group consists of the same number of matched subjects, and all subjects have measurements in each group. If your dataset is incomplete and does not have all measurements for all subjects across all groups, ProViz will attempt to adjust the data as necessary. This may, however result in errors. If missing values (NAs) are found in any group labels (Two-group Response or Multi-group Response), or any Matching Variable, the observations with those missing values will be removed and a notice will be displayed. The following tables illustrate how Grouping and Matching variables should be constructed for the 2-group and multi-group tests, as well as their paired or repeated measures counterparts. For a two-group test, such as a t-test, U-test, or KS-test, samples must be divided into 2 groups. In Table 6.1, each sample is assigned to either Group_A or Group_B. If each subject is unique - no repeated samples are taken from the same subject - then only the SampleId and Group_Id columns are needed. In the example in Table 6.1, there would be 10 subjects, 5 in Group_A and 5 in Group_B, and the Matching_Id column is not needed. If, however, samples were taken from each subject twice - for example, a pre-treated and post-treated sample taken from every subject - an additional column is required to indicate which samples came from the same subject. In the example in Table 6.1, there would be only 5 subjects, and a sample was taken from each subject twice. The Matching_Id column indicates which samples came from the same subjects across the 2 groups. Table 6.1: Two-Group Test Grouping and Matching Variable Example SampleId Group_Id Matching_Id Sample_1 Group_A Subject_1 Sample_2 Group_A Subject_2 Sample_3 Group_A Subject_3 Sample_4 Group_A Subject_4 Sample_5 Group_A Subject_5 Sample_6 Group_B Subject_1 Sample_7 Group_B Subject_2 Sample_8 Group_B Subject_3 Sample_9 Group_B Subject_4 Sample_10 Group_B Subject_5 Sample_1 Group_A Subject_1 Sample_2 Group_A Subject_2 Sample_3 Group_A Subject_3 Sample_4 Group_A Subject_4 Sample_5 Group_A Subject_5 Sample_6 Group_B Subject_1 Sample_7 Group_B Subject_2 Sample_8 Group_B Subject_3 Sample_9 Group_B Subject_4 Sample_10 Group_B Subject_5 For a multi-group test, such as ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, repeated measures ANOVA and Friedman’s Test, the Grouping and Matching works similarly but with more than two groups. If each subject is unique - no repeated samples are taken from the same subject - then only the SampleId and Group_Id columns are needed. In the example shown in Table 6.2, there would be 20 subjects, 5 in each group and the Matching_Id column is not needed. If, however, samples were taken from each subject twice - for example, a time course study with samples taken from each subject at each of 4 timepoints - an additional column is required to indicate which samples came from the same subject. In the example in Table 6.2, there would be only 5 subjects, and a sample was taken from each subject four times. The Matching_Id column indicates which samples came from the same subjects across the 4 groups.

After the statistical test is complete and the results table has been loaded, a volcano plot is displayed. For the t-test and U-test, this plot illustrates each SOMAmer-detected protein as a point with the X-axis being the log2(fold change) and the Y-axis being -log10(p-value). For a correlation test, the X-axis will illustrate the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. For ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Friedman’s Test, the X-axis will illustrate the maximum fold-change between medians of all groups. The left slider (Fold Change (log2) for all tests except correlation, and Correlation for the correlation test) and the p-value slider can be used to adjust the vertical and horizontal red lines in the plot, which represent cutoff values for identifying biomarkers of interest. Selecting p-value, FDR, or Bonferroni will determine which type of p-value correction is used for plotting. Hovering over points on the volcano plot will provide a pop-out detailing information of the SOMAmer reagent associated with that point. Additionally, a table will be displayed below the Statistical Tests box with summary information as well as a plot to the right illustrating the data behind the selected point. For correlation tests, a scatter plot of the SOMAmer-detected protein data versus the response will be displayed. For all other tests, boxplots or CDF plots for that SOMAmer-detected protein are shown - the plot can be changed between boxplot and CDF by selecting under Plot Options. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 and individual points can be displayed by selecting Beeswarm. Hovering over points on this plot will provide additional information about the specific sample associated with that point, and hovering over the boxplot will provide summary statistics. The Y-axis of the plot can be labeled with the Sequence ID, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol by selecting the appropriate item under Data Label. For matched tests, matched observations across groups can be connected with lines by selecting the Plot Matched checkbox on the Distribution Plot. 6.5 Statistical Results Table The Statistical Results Table in the Statistical Tests panel. Results of the statistical test performed for all SOMAmer reagents will be displayed in the Statistical Results Table. All protein identifiers (SOMAmer ID, Protein Name, UniProt ID, Gene Symbol) will be displayed along with Fold Change, Maximum Fold Change, or r (Pearson’s correlation coefficient), depending on the chosen test. Additional columns contain, the test statistic, p-value, and p-values adjusted for multiple testing by False Discovery Rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction. The table can be sorted by clicking on the double arrow next to any column name, or searched for protein name or gene symbol. Selecting a row in the table will result in that point being illustrated in the volcano plot as well as a distribution or scatter plot. "]]
