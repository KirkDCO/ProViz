"],["load-and-filter-adat.html", "Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel 2.2 Load an ADAT file 2.3 Filter ADAT contents", " Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel The ProViz Load and Filter ADAT panel after opening the example_data.adat file. 2.2 Load an ADAT file To open an ADAT file, click on the Browse… button and locate an ADAT file. Once selected, the ADAT file will be opened and processed, and a preview of the content will be shown in the table at the right. ADAT files may have over 7,000 columns of SomaScan Assay data for every row in the file, so large files may take a few moments to load. After the ADAT file is loaded, details of the file content are displayed. Here we see that there are 192 total rows (corresponding to individual samples), and 5,318 data columns. Of those data columns, 5,284 are SOMAmer data columns and 34 are Meta Data columns. These Meta Data columns contain assay-related data such as the Plate ID, Scanner ID, normalization data, and any sample-specific data that was submitted to SomaLogic with the samples. For the example_data.adat file, Sex and Age are included as well as various assay-related content. The ADAT Preview table can be scroleld as well as searched for specific content (Search: box in upper-right). SomaScan Assay data are not displayed in the preview table. 2.3 Filter ADAT contents Samples present in the ADAT file can be filtered based on Meta Data or SomaScan Assay data. When the ADAT file is processed, data columns are divided into Categorical (non-numeric) or Continuous (numeric) categories. All filtering operations are cumulative. 2.3.1 Categorical Filters The categorical filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on categorical data using the Categorical Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By selection box, which populates the Remove selection box with the unique categorical values in the ADAT file. Data values can be selected by clicking on one or more values in the Remove selection box. Once all selections are made, clicking the Apply button will remove those samples from the data, and the Data Dimensions box will be updated with new information. In this example, the SampleType column is selected and the unique entries for this column are shown: Buffer, Calibrator, QC, and Sample. By clicking on Buffer, Calibrator, and QC, to select them, the assay control samples can be removed from the data file. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.2 Continuous Filters The continuous filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on continuous data using the Continuous Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By which will update the Range slider with the minimum and maximum values for that data column. By moving the minimum and maximum sliders, a desired range of the selected variable can be chosen and all samples with values outside that range will be removed. In this example, the Age column is seleted and the sliders adjusted to keep only those samples with Age from 35 to 70. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.3 Reset Filters The original ADAT contents are always preserved and can be retrieved by clicking the Reset All Filters button. 2.3.4 Download ADAT Once filtering has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten. Keeping good notes regarding the filtering operations is essential to recall how the ADAT was modified when it is returned to at a later date. "],["merge-data.html", "Chapter 3 Merge Data 3.1 Selecting a Data File to Merge 3.2 Selecting Columns in the ADAT and the Data File 3.3 Specifying the Type of Merge 3.4 Merge 3.5 Download Adat", " Chapter 3 Merge Data Data stored in external files can be merged with the proteomic data in an ADAT file using the Merge Data panel. The Merge Data panel 3.1 Selecting a Data File to Merge External data must be stored in a comma-delimited or a tab-delimited file, and the first row should contain column names. The file containing the data can be uploaded to ProViz by selecting the Browse button and navigating to the file. Once uploaded, a preview of the data file will be displayed below the ADAT Preview. 3.2 Selecting Columns in the ADAT and the Data File In order to merge external data with the data in the ADAT file, each file should have one column that provides a way to match rows between the two files. Ideally, the columns should have all unique values and should match one-to-one between the ADAT file and the external data file. The target column in the ADAT can be selected with the ADAT Merge Column selection box, and the column in the external file can be selected with the Data Merge Column selection box. The columns do not need to have the same name. In this example, each file has a column titled SampleId. All entries in this column in the external file are unique and correspond to the clinical samples’ SampleId values in the ADAT. 3.3 Specifying the Type of Merge The ADAT file typically contains control samples for which external data is not likely available, or the external data file may not have data for all clinical samples. Choosing Keep All ADAT Rows under Type of Merge will retain all rows in the ADAT file and include NA for those rows not found in the external file. Alternatively, only those rows found in both files can be retained by selecting Keep Only Intersection. 3.4 Merge Once all selections are made, initiate the merge by pressing the Merge button. If an error occurs, a message will be displayed in the message box at the bottom of the panel, otherwise, the message box will contain updated data dimension information. The message box will provide the exact error message from the underlying R code, and may not be easily interpreted. Typically, if an error occurs, it is due to selecting columns in either the ADAT or the external file that are not campatible. 3.5 Download Adat Once merging has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten. Keeping good notes regarding the filtering operations is essential to recall how the ADAT was modified when it is returned to at a later date.

Samples labeled with categorical data can be combined to create only 2 groups, or continuous values can be split to create 2 groups. The Create Group panel. 4.1 Creating a New Group from Continuous Data The Create New Group box with Continuous options selected. The column containing the new group variable can be named in the New Column Name box. For splitting a continuous variable, select Continuous from the Create From options. The column containing the data to be split can be selected from the Source Column selection box. Labels for the two groups are specified under Group A Label and Group B Label. Adjust the Group Split Value slider to identify the split point for the data. Rows with values less than the chosen split will be given the label Group A and rows with values greater than or equal to the chosen split will be given the label Group B. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 Transform. A preview of the original data column and the newly created data column are shown at the right. When ready to create the new group, press the Create New Group Column button, and the new column will be added to the ADAT. In this example, a column titled New Group will be created from the existing Age column. Rows with values less than 50 will be given the label A and values greater than or equal to 50 will be given the label B. 4.2 Creating a New Group from Categorical Data The Create New Group box with Categorical options selected. The column containing the new group variable can be named in the New Column Name box. For splitting a categorical variable, select Categorical from the Create From options. Clicking on the Group A or Group B select boxes will show the categorical values available from the chosen column. Selections can be made by clicking on the categorical values desired for that group. Labels for the two groups are specified under Group A Label and Group B Label. A preview of the original data column and the newly created data column are shown at the right. When ready to create the new group, press the Create New Group Column button, and the new column will be added to the ADAT. In this example, a column titled New Group will be created from the existing SampleType column. Rows with values of Calibrator, Buffer, or QC will be given the label Controls and values of Sample will be given the label Samples. This will provide a useful label to distinguish between all controls and all clinical samples in the ADAT file. 4.3 Download ADAT Once new groups have been created, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten.

The tests available are: correlation - compares two continuous variables using either Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank-based methods t-test - compares the means of two groups; a paired t-test is also available U-test - compares the medians of two groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test; a paired U-test is also available KS-test - compares the distributions of data between two groups ANOVA - Analysis of Variance test of the means of multiple groups; repeated measures ANOVA is also available Kruskal-Wallis - compares the medians of multiple groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA Friedman’s Test - a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA 6.1.1 Selecting a Response The Settings box in the Statistical Tests panel. The type of test can be selected from Test Type. The variable containing the response or the grouping labels can be selected from the select box titled Continuous Response, Two-group Response, or Multi-group Response. The label of the select box will change as different test types are selected. Also, the contents of the select box will be updated with varaibles consistent with the selected test. After selecting a new response variable, tests will be performed for all SOMAmers in the ADAT, which could take a minute or two. If a paired t-test, paired U-test, repeated measures ANOVA, or Friedman’s test are required, check the Matched Samples box and select the variable which defines how samples are matched across groups. All matched tests require a complete dataset in which each treatment group consists of the same number of matched subjects, and all subjects have measurements in each group. If your dataset is incomplete and does not have all measurements for all subjects across all groups, ProViz will attempt to adjust the data as necessary. This may, however result in errors. Once a test has been conducted, the Statistical Results Table will contain all test results and can be downloaded as a comma-separated file (.csv) by clicking the Download Results button. 6.1.2 Plots The Volcano Plot and Distribution Plot in the Statistical Tests panel. After the statistical test is complete and the results table has been loaded, a volcano plot is displayed. For the t-test and U-test, this plot illustrates each SOMAmer as a point with the X-axis being the log2(fold change) and the Y-axis being -log10(p-value). For a correlation test, the X-axis will illustrate the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. For ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, the X-axis will illustrate the maximum fold-change between groups. The left slider (Fold Change (log2) for all tests except correlation, and Correlation for the correlation test) and the p-value slider can be used to adjust the vertical and horizontal red lines in the plot, which represent cutoff values for identifying biomarkers of interest. Selecting p-value, FDR, or Bonferroni will determine which type of p-value correction is used for plotting. Hovering over points on the volcano plot will provide a pop-out detailing information of the SOMAmer associated with that point. Additionally, selecting a point by clicking on it will result in a plot illustrating the selected point’s details. For correlation tests, a scatter plot of the SOMAmer data versus the response will be displayed. For all other tests, boxplots or CDF plots for that SOMAmer are shown - the plot can be changed between boxplot and CDF by selecting under Plot Options. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 and individual points can be displayed by selecting Beeswarm. Hovering over points on this plot will provide additional information about the specific sample associated with that point, and hovering over the boxplot will provide summary statistics. The Y-axis of the plot can be labeled with the SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol by selecting the appropriate item under Data Label. For matched tests, matched observations across groups can be connected with lines by selecting the Plot Matched checkbox on the Distribution Plot. 6.1.3 Statistical Results Table The Statistical Results Table in the Statistical Tests panel. Results of the statistical test performed for all SOMAmers will be displayed in the Statistical Results Table. All protein identifiers (SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, Gene Symbol) will be displayed along with Fold Change, Maximum Fold Change, or r (Pearson’s correlation coefficient), depending on the chosen test. Additional columns contain, the test statistic, p-value, and p-values adjusted for multiple testing by False Discovery Rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction. The table can be sorted by clicking on the double arrow next to any column name, or searched for protein name or gene symbol. Selecting a row in the table will result in that point being illustrated in the volcano plot as well as a distribution or scatter plot. "]]

The column name can be selected from the Filter By selection box, which populates the Remove selection box with the unique categorical values in the ADAT file. Data values can be selected by clicking on one or more values in the Remove selection box. Once all selections are made, clicking the Apply button will remove those samples from the data, and the Data Dimensions box will be updated with new information. In this example, the SampleType column is selected and the unique entries for this column are shown: Buffer, Calibrator, QC, and Sample. By clicking on Buffer, Calibrator, and QC, to select them, the assay control samples can be removed from the data file. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.2 Continuous Filters The continuous filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on continuous data using the Continuous Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By which will update the Range slider with the minimum and maximum values for that data column. By moving the minimum and maximum sliders, a desired range of the selected variable can be chosen and all samples with values outside that range will be removed. In this example, the Age column is seleted and the sliders adjusted to keep only those samples with Age from 35 to 70. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.3 Reset Filters The original ADAT contents are always preserved and can be retrieved by clicking the Reset All Filters button. 2.3.4 Download ADAT Once filtering has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive file name is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten. Keeping good notes regarding the filtering operations is essential to recall how the ADAT was modified when it is returned to at a later date.

The tests available are: correlation - compares two continuous variables using either Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank-based methods t-test - compares the means of two groups; a paired t-test is also available U-test - compares the medians of two groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test; a paired U-test is also available KS-test - compares the distributions of data between two groups ANOVA - Analysis of Variance test of the means of multiple groups; repeated measures ANOVA is also available Kruskal-Wallis - compares the medians of multiple groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA Friedman’s Test - a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA 6.1.1 Selecting a Response The Settings box in the Statistical Tests panel. The type of test can be selected from Test Type. The variable containing the response or the grouping labels can be selected from the select box titled Continuous Response, Two-group Response, or Multi-group Response. The label of the select box will change as different test types are selected. Also, the contents of the select box will be updated with varaibles consistent with the selected test. After selecting a new response variable, tests will be performed for all SOMAmers in the ADAT, which could take a minute or two. If a paired t-test, paired U-test, repeated measures ANOVA, or Friedman’s test are required, check the Matched Samples box and select the variable which defines how samples are matched across groups. All matched tests require a complete dataset in which each treatment group consists of the same number of matched subjects, and all subjects have measurements in each group. If your dataset is incomplete and does not have all measurements for all subjects across all groups, ProViz will attempt to adjust the data as necessary. This may, however result in errors. Once a test has been conducted, the Statistical Results Table will contain all test results and can be downloaded as a comma-separated file (.csv) by clicking the Download Results button. 6.1.2 Plots The Volcano Plot and Distribution Plot in the Statistical Tests panel. After the statistical test is complete and the results table has been loaded, a volcano plot is displayed. For the t-test and U-test, this plot illustrates each SOMAmer as a point with the X-axis being the log2(fold change) and the Y-axis being -log10(p-value). For a correlation test, the X-axis will illustrate the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. For ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, the X-axis will illustrate the maximum fold-change between groups. The left slider (Fold Change (log2) for all tests except correlation, and Correlation for the correlation test) and the p-value slider can be used to adjust the vertical and horizontal red lines in the plot, which represent cutoff values for identifying biomarkers of interest. Selecting p-value, FDR, or Bonferroni will determine which type of p-value correction is used for plotting. Hovering over points on the volcano plot will provide a pop-out detailing information of the SOMAmer associated with that point. Additionally, selecting a point by clicking on it will result in a plot illustrating the selected point’s details. For correlation tests, a scatter plot of the SOMAmer data versus the response will be displayed. For all other tests, boxplots or CDF plots for that SOMAmer are shown - the plot can be changed between boxplot and CDF by selecting under Plot Options. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 and individual points can be displayed by selecting Beeswarm. Hovering over points on this plot will provide additional information about the specific sample associated with that point, and hovering over the boxplot will provide summary statistics. The Y-axis of the plot can be labeled with the SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol by selecting the appropriate item under Data Label. For matched tests, matched observations across groups can be connected with lines by selecting the Plot Matched checkbox on the Distribution Plot. 6.1.3 Statistical Results Table The Statistical Results Table in the Statistical Tests panel. Results of the statistical test performed for all SOMAmers will be displayed in the Statistical Results Table. All protein identifiers (SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, Gene Symbol) will be displayed along with Fold Change, Maximum Fold Change, or r (Pearson’s correlation coefficient), depending on the chosen test. Additional columns contain, the test statistic, p-value, and p-values adjusted for multiple testing by False Discovery Rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction. The table can be sorted by clicking on the double arrow next to any column name, or searched for protein name or gene symbol. Selecting a row in the table will result in that point being illustrated in the volcano plot as well as a distribution or scatter plot. "]]

Plot toolbar The icons from left to right provide the following features. download as PNG - saves the image to a file zoom - when selected, the plot can be zoomed by clicking and dragging the mouse pan - when selected, the plot can be moved by clicking a dragging zoom in - zooms into the plot, keeping the current center zoom out - zooms into the plot, keping the current center autoscale - resets the coordinates of the plot if it has been zoomed or panned (similar to reset axes, below) reset axes - resets coordinates of the plot if it has been zoomed or panned (similar to autoscael, above) toggle spike lines - when selected, hovering over points on the graph will also include lines from teh point to the axes show closest data on hover - only informaiton about the closest data point will be shown when the point is hovered over compare data on hover - if multiple points are plotted at the same location, data for all points will be shown Plotly icon - a link to the Plotly website. Plotly is the tool used by ProViz to produce graphs. 5.2 Dynamic Plot Interactions At any point during plotting, the plots provide dynamic interaction capabilities. Hovering on the plotted elements themselves, such as boxes in a box plot or points in any plot, provides additional information about the samples corresponding to that plotting element. Plots can be zoomed or panned by clicking and dragging - see the details above in Plot Features. 5.3 Boxplots The Boxplot panel with a customized plot. 5.3.1 Axes The Axes tab in the Plot Settings box. A categorical variable that defines the boxes in the boxplot can be selected from the X-axis select box. If the categorical variable has missing values (NAs), those can be removed by selected Remove NAs. A continuous variable can be selecged from the Y-axis select box. The continuous variable can be transformed by log10 by selecting Y-axis Log10. 5.3.2 Colors and Points The Colors and Points tabs in the Plot Settings box. Colors of boxes can be customized by selecting from the Color select box, and the degree of transparency can be adjusted with the Alpha slider on the left. Individual points for each sample can be displayed by selected Beeswarm. Colors of the points can be customized by selecting a color from Beeswarm point color and the transparency can be adjusted with the Alpha slider on the right. The size of the points can be adjusted with the Point Size slider. 5.3.3 Title and Size The Title and Size tab in the Plot Settings box. A title and subtitle can be added to the plot by entering text into the Title and Subtitle boxes. The plot size can be adjusted using the Plot Height and Plot Width sliders. 5.4 CDF Plots The CDF panel with a customized plot. 5.4.1 Axes The Axes tab in the Plot Settings box. A continuous variable can be selected from the X-axis select box. The continuous variable can be log10 transformed by selecting X-axis Log10. 5.4.2 Lines and Points The Lines and Points tab in the Plot Settings box. A categorical variable can be selected from the Color By select box, which will produce one CDF for each category in that variable. If there are NAs for some samples, a CDF will also be produced for NA-containing set, or it can be removed by selecting Remove NAs. Line width can be adjusted using the Line Width slider, and point sizes can be adjusted with the Point Size slider. If the Point Size slider is set to 0, points will be removed from the plot. 5.4.3 Title and Size The Title and Size tab in the Plot Settings box.

The plot size can be adjusted using the Plot Height and Plot Width sliders. 5.5 Scatter Plots The Scatter Plot panel with a customized plot. 5.5.1 Axes The Axes tab in the Plot Settings box. To set the X- and Y-axes, select continuous variables from the X-axis and Y-axis select boxes. Selecting X-axis Log10 or Y-axis Log10 will log10 transform the data for that axis. 5.5.2 Points The Points tab in the Plot Settings box. Individual points can be colored in multiple ways depending on the selection for Color By. If Static is selected, all points will be the same color, and that color can be chosen from the Point Color select box. If Continuous is selected, points can be colored by a gradient across two colors based upon the value of a chosen variable. Chose the variable using the Variable select box. The values for the variable can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 Transform. The colors to use for the gradient can be chosen by selecting colors from Start Color and End Color. If Category is selected, points can be colored based upon a categorical variable. The variable can be chosen from the Variable select box. Points can also be sized by adjusting the Point Size slider, and their transparency adjusted using the Point Alpha slider. If there are NAs present, they can be removed by selecting Remove NAs. 5.5.3 Lines The Lines tab in the Plot Settings box. A linear regression line can be added to the plot by selecting Regression Line. The width of the line can be adjusted with the Regression Line Width slider, it can be colored by selecting a color from Regression Line Color, and the plotting style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) can be selected from the Regression Liney Style select box. An \\(R^2\\) of the correlation can be added to the plot by selecting an position option from the Add R^2 to Plot select box. An identity line can be added to the plot by selecting Identity Line. Identity lines are useful to illustrate the expected, perfect one-to-one relationship between two variables. Selecting Make axes equivalent will create a square plot in which the extents of the X- and Y-axes are the same. The identity line can be adjusted for width with the Identity Line Width slider, the color can be selected from the Identity Line Color select box, and the plotting style selected from the Identity Line Style select box. 5.5.4 Title and Size The Title and Size tab int he Plot Settings box. A title and subtitle can be added to the plot by entering text into the Title and Subtitle boxes. The plot size can be adjusted using the Plot Height and Plot Width sliders. "],["statistical-tests.html", "Chapter 6 Statistical Tests 6.1 Statistical Tests", " Chapter 6 Statistical Tests The Statistical Tests panel. 6.1 Statistical Tests Different statistical tests for comparing continuous, two-group data, or multi-group data can be performed on the Statistical Tests panel. The tests available are: correlation - compares two continuous variables using either Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank-based methods t-test - compares the means of two groups; a paired t-test is also available U-test - compares the medians of two groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test; a paired U-test is also available KS-test - compares the distributions of data between two groups ANOVA - Analysis of Variance test of the means of multiple groups; repeated measures ANOVA is also available Kruskal-Wallis - compares the medians of multiple groups; this is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA Friedman’s Test - a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA 6.1.1 Selecting a Response The Settings box in the Statistical Tests panel. The type of test can be selected from Test Type. The variable containing the response or the grouping labels can be selected from the select box titled Continuous Response, Two-group Response, or Multi-group Response. The label of the select box will change as different test types are selected. Also, the contents of the select box will be updated with varaibles consistent with the selected test. After selecting a new response variable, tests will be performed for all SOMAmers in the ADAT, which could take a minute or two. If a paired t-test, paired U-test, repeated measures ANOVA, or Friedman’s test are required, check the Matched Samples box and select the variable which defines how samples are matched across groups. All matched tests require a complete dataset in which each treatment group consists of the same number of matched subjects, and all subjects have measurements in each group. If your dataset is incomplete and does not have all measurements for all subjects across all groups, ProViz will attempt to adjust the data as necessary. This may, however result in errors. Once a test has been conducted, the Statistical Results Table will contain all test results and can be downloaded as a comma-separated file (.csv) by clicking the Download Results button. 6.1.2 Plots The Volcano Plot and Distribution Plot in the Statistical Tests panel. After the statistical test is complete and the results table has been loaded, a volcano plot is displayed. For the t-test and U-test, this plot illustrates each SOMAmer as a point with the X-axis being the log2(fold change) and the Y-axis being -log10(p-value). For a correlation test, the X-axis will illustrate the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. For ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, the X-axis will illustrate the maximum fold-change between groups. The left slider (Fold Change (log2) for all tests except correlation, and Correlation for the correlation test) and the p-value slider can be used to adjust the vertical and horizontal red lines in the plot, which represent cutoff values for identifying biomarkers of interest. Selecting p-value, FDR, or Bonferroni will determine which type of p-value correction is used for plotting. Hovering over points on the volcano plot will provide a pop-out detailing information of the SOMAmer associated with that point. Additionally, selecting a point by clicking on it will result in a plot illustrating the selected point’s details. For correlation tests, a scatter plot of the SOMAmer data versus the response will be displayed. For all other tests, boxplots or CDF plots for that SOMAmer are shown - the plot can be changed between boxplot and CDF by selecting under Plot Options. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 and individual points can be displayed by selecting Beeswarm. Hovering over points on this plot will provide additional information about the specific sample associated with that point, and hovering over the boxplot will provide summary statistics. The Y-axis of the plot can be labeled with the SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol by selecting the appropriate item under Data Label. For matched tests, matched observations across groups can be connected with lines by selecting the Plot Matched checkbox on the Distribution Plot. 6.1.3 Statistical Results Table The Statistical Results Table in the Statistical Tests panel. Results of the statistical test performed for all SOMAmers will be displayed in the Statistical Results Table. All protein identifiers (SOMAmer Id, Protein Name, Gene Symbol) will be displayed along with Fold Change, Maximum Fold Change, or r (Pearson’s correlation coefficient), depending on the chosen test. Additional columns contain, the test statistic, p-value, and p-values adjusted for multiple testing by False Discovery Rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction. The table can be sorted by clicking on the double arrow next to any column name, or searched for protein name or gene symbol. Selecting a row in the table will result in that point being illustrated in the volcano plot as well as a distribution or scatter plot. "]]
