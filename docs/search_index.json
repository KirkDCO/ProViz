The source code is available on GitHub in SomaLogic’s ProViz repository. To use ProViz, it is recommended to install RStudio, clone the ProViz repository, and run it using the RStudio IDE. See RStudio’s Shiny page for details of using RStudio to run a Shiny application. RStudio’s Shiny Server can also be used to run ProViz from a server, providing access through a managed web portal. Some additional packages are required for ProViz. Following is a list of the required packages and the versions used during ProViz development and testing. All of the following packages are available through CThe Comprehensive R Network - CRAN. shiny (v1.5.0) shinydashboard (v0.7.1) shinyWidgets (0.5.7) DT (0.17) dplyr (1.0.4) ggbeeswarm (0.6.0) ggplot2 (3.3.3) magrittr (2.0.1) plotly (4.9.3) readr (1.4.0) Additionally, ProViz uses the SomaDataIO v5.0.0 available from SomaLogic’s SomaDataIO GitHub repository 1.1.2 DockerHub 1.2 Example Data The example data used in this tutorial can be found at SomaLogic’s SomaLogic-Data GitHub repository where you can find a description of the file and the ADAT file format. The example_data.adat file consists of 192 samples (including clinical samples and controls) and is representative of a typical ADAT file SomaLogic customer’s receive. 1.3 ProViz Navigation The main ProViz panel. In ProViz, you can navigate to different panels using the navigation pane on the left by clicking on the name of the panel. Each chapter in this tutorial gives a brief tutorial on how to use the options in the corresponding panel. Under Label SOMAmers by: users can select how they would like the SOMAmer-associated data to be listed in selection boxes across all panels. You can choose SOMAmer ID, Protein Name, or Gene Symbol. The latter two options are most likely more familiar to most users than SOMAmer IDs. You can change between label types at any point when using ProViz, but be aware that plots may be reset if a different label type is chosen. "],["load-and-filter-adat.html", "Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel 2.2 Load an ADAT file 2.3 Filter ADAT contents", " Chapter 2 Load and Filter ADAT 2.1 The Load and Filter ADAT Panel The ProViz Load and Filter ADAT panel after opening the example_data.adat file. 2.2 Load an ADAT file To open an ADAT file, click on the Browse… button and locate your ADAT file. Once selected, the ADAT file will be opened and processed, and a preview of the content will be shown in the table at the right. ADAT files may have over 7,000 columns of SomaScan data for every row in the file, so large files may take a few moments to load. After the ADAT file is loaded, details of the file content are displayed. Here we see that there are 192 total rows (corresponding to individual samples), and 5,318 data columns. Of those data columns, 5,284 are SOMAmer data columns and 34 are Meta Data columns. These Meta Data columns contain assay-related data such as the Plate ID, Scanner ID, normalization data, and any sample-specific data that was submitted to SomaLogic with the samples. For the example_data.adat file, Sex and Age are included as well as various assay-related content. You can scroll through the ADAT Preview table as well as searching for specific content (Search: box in upper-right). SOMAmer-related data are not displayed in the preview table. 2.3 Filter ADAT contents Samples present in the ADAT file can be filtered based on Meta Data or SOMAmer data. When the ADAT file is processed, data columns are divided into Categorical (non-numeric) or Continuous (numeric) categories. All filtering operations are cumulative. 2.3.1 Categorical Filters The categorical filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on categorical data using the Categorical Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By selection box, which populates the Remove selection box with the unique categorical values in the ADAT file. Data values can be selected by clicking on one or more values in the Remove selection box. Once all selections are made, clicking the Apply button will remove those samples from the data, and the Data Dimensions box will be updated with new information. In this example, the SampleType column is selected and the unique entries for this column are shown: Buffer, Calibrator, QC, and Sample. By selecting Buffer, Calibrator, and QC, the assay control samples can be removed from the data file. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.2 Continuous Filters The continuous filters box. Samples can be filtered from the ADAT based on continuous data using the Continuous Filters box. The column name can be selected from the Filter By which will update the Range slider with the minimum and maximum values for that data column. By moving the minimum and maximum sliders, a desired range of the selected variable can be chosen and all samples with values outside that range will be removed. In this example, the Age column is seleted and the sliders adjusted to keep only those samples with Age from 35 to 70. Checking the Filter samples with no entry box will remove all samples lacking a value for the selected column. 2.3.3 Reset Filters The original ADAT contents are always preserved and can be retrieved by clicking the Reset All Filters button. 2.3.4 Download ADAT Once filtering has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified for content relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive filename is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten and that the filtering operations can be determined if you return to the modified file at a later date.

The Merge Data panel 3.1 Selecting a Data File to Merge External data must be stored in a comma-delimited or a tab-delimited file, and the first row should contain column names. The file containing the data can be uploaded to ProViz by selecting the Browse button and navigating to the file. Once uploaded, a preview of the data file will be displayed at the lower left, below the ADAT Preview. 3.2 Selecting Columns in the ADAT and the Data File In order to merge external data with the data in the ADAT file, each file should have one column that provides a way to match rows between the two files. Ideally, the columns should have all unique values and should match one-to-one between the ADAT file and the external data file. The target column in the ADAT can be selected with the ADAT Merge Column selection box, and the column in the external file can be selected with the Data Merge Column selection box. The columns do not need to have the same name. In this example, each file has a column titled SampleId. All this column’s entries in the external file are unique and correspond to the clinical samples SampleId values in the ADAT. 3.3 Specifying the Type of Merge The ADAT file typically contains control samples for which external data is not likely available, or the external data file may not have data for all clinical samples. Choosing Keep All ADAT Rows under Type of Merge will retain all rows in the ADAT file and include NA for those rows not found in the external file. Alternatively, only those rows found in both files can be retained by selecting Keep Only Intersection. 3.4 Merge Once all selections are made, initiate the merge by pressing the Merge button. If an error occurs, a message will be displayed in the message box at the bottom of the panel, otherwise, the message box will contain updated data dimension information. 3.5 Download Adat Once merging has been performed, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button. As this new ADAT file may be significantly modified for content relative to the original, ensure that a new, unique, descriptive filename is specified so that the original ADAT is not overwritten and that the filtering operations can be determined if you return to the modified file at a later date.

The column containing the new group variable can be named in the New Column Name box. For splitting a continuous variable, select Continuous from the Create From options. The column containing the data to be split can be selected from the Source Column selection box. Labels for the two groups are specified under Group A Label and Group B Label. Adjust the Group Split Value slider to identify the split point for the data. Rows with values less than the chosen split will be given the label Group A and rows with values greater than or equal to the chosen split will be given the label Group B. Data can be log10 transformed by selecting Log10 Transform. A preview of the original data column and the newly created data column are shown at the right. When ready to create the new group, press the Create New Group Column button, and the new column will be added to the ADAT. In this example, a column titled New Group will be created from the existing Age column. Rows with values less than 50 will be given the label Group A and values greater than or equal to 50 will be given the label Group B. 4.2 Creating a New Group from Categorical Data The Create New Group box with Categorical options selected. The column containing the new group variable can be named in the New Column Name box. For splitting a categorical variable, select Categorical from the Create From options. Clicking on the Group A or Group B select boxes will be show the categorical values available from the chosen column. Selections can be made by clicking on the categorical values desired for that group. Labels for the two groups are specified under Group A Label and Group B Label. A preview of the original data column and the newly created data column are shown at the right. When ready to create the new group, press the Create New Group Column button, and the new column will be added to the ADAT. In this example, a column titled New Group will be created from the existing SampleType column. Rows with values of Calibrator, Buffer, or QC will be given the label Controls and values of Sample will be given the label Saples. This will provide a useful label to distinguish between all controls and all clinical samples in the ADAT file. 4.3 Download ADAT Once new groups have been created, a version of the ADAT can be downloaded by clicking the Download ADAT button.
